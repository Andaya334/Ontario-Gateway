# Ontario-Gateway
Hypothesis Testing/Simulation


Step 1: Model Setup\
Define each insurance plan’s premium, deductible, and coverage limits in the simulation.
Incorporate the crash probability into the model based on fleet size, flight frequency, and annual operations.
Calculate expected annual losses and project out over the five-year term.

Step 2: Simulate Annual Costs for Each Plan\
Crash Probability Simulation: Use Monte Carlo simulations to account for random crash events, factoring in Ontario Gateway’s safer-than-average fleet.
Loss Calculation: For each simulated year, determine potential claims based on the number of accidents, replacement cost, and deductible structure of each policy.

Step 3: Evaluate Financial Impact Under Constraints\
Maximum Loss Limitation: Calculate the probability that the total loss exceeds $37 million, ensuring the policy aligns with Ontario Gateway’s $41 million liability threshold.
Cost Minimization: Compare the overall premium and out-of-pocket expenses across all five years for each policy, accounting for rebates and variable costs.

Step 4: Sensitivity Analysis (Part c)\
Modify the crash rate to reflect a 25% safer-than-average probability.
Re-run simulations to observe how this lower crash probability impacts expected costs and coverage needs under each insurance plan.
Evaluate the robustness of each policy under this adjusted probability to inform the final decision.

Step 5: Final Recommendation (Part d)\
Prepare a data-backed recommendation based on total projected costs, risk coverage adequacy, and Ontario Gateway’s financial goals.
Detail the decision rationale with an executive summary, outlining risk considerations, the five-year outlook, and why the chosen policy is the optimal solution for Ontario Gateway.

This case is a case based on simulation and hypothesis testing on Ontario gateway insurance recommendations.
